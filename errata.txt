course: 
LinkedIn Learning : React: Creating and Hosting a Full-Stack Site

Issues & Suggestions while taking this course include the following:

Ch 1 Lesson 8 : Creating a 404 page
-------------------------------------
ISSUE: The instructor does not explain how to handle the browser dev tools error regarding "src/App.jsx" throwing an error due to an undefined article.

The instructor introduces "errorElement" into the routes within "src/App.jsx". The instructor points out that the error in "src/pages/ArticlePage.jsx" will force React Router to display the "PageNotFound" component to render. This indeed happens.
However, the instructor does not address the error in the console from the ArticlePage component and how to best resolve this error.


Ch 2 Lesson 2 : Setting up an Express server
---------------------------------------------
ISSUE: The instructor does not address the '.gitignore" files 

 It would help if the instructor would help describe how to manage multiple ".gitignore" files within a project. This could prevent accidentally commiting/pushing changes to "node_modules", etc.
 At this point we have a top level directory and subdirectories 'front-end' and 'back-end'. The 'back-end' directory does not have a .gitignore but the top level directory and 'front-end' directory does.


Ch 2 Lesson 3 : Testing an Express server with Postman
-------------------------------------------------------
ISSUE: The instructor does not go into detail about a POST request or Postman.

It would help if the instructor took a couple minutes to explain middleware such as parsing incoming JSON, explore "express.use()", and do a quick walkthrough of the request and response objects in Express.
