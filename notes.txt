NOTES:
======================


1. Starting MongoDB
   On Mac with brew, it sucks starting & stopping mongodb

     $ brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community

     $ brew services stop mongodb/brew/mongodb-community


2. Starting Express server a few ways:
   A. You can use Node's built-in "--watch" flag

    back-end$ node --watch src/server.js

    OR
   
    [package.json]
      {
      ...
        scripts: {
          dev: 'node --watch src/server'
        }
      ...
      }

     back-end$ npm run dev

  
  B. You can install the nodemon npm package (locally or globally)

     (Globally)
     back-end$ npm install -g nodemon
     back-end$ nodemon src/server.js

     [package.json] 
       {
        scripts: {
          dev: 'nodemon src/server.js'
        }
       }

     back-end$ npm run dev


     (Locally)
     npm install --save-dev nodemon

     back-end: npx nodemon src/server.js

     [package.json]
       {
        scripts: {
          dev: 'npx nodemon src/server.js'
        }
       }

    back-end: npm run dev




3. ERROR: No `HydrateFallback` element
   I made a typo that got me stuck trying to determine what Hydrate and Fallback was.
   NOTE: This error also came up later in the course when using react-router-dom 7.6.1
   To troubleshoot I installed/uninstalled versions of 'react-router-dom' new(7.6.1)/old(6.4).

   A typo was eventually discovered, the root of the issue, which was using {} instead of () to wrap jsx.
   This fix got rid of the hydration Fallback error.

    ERROR:
    ----------------------------------
    [src/CommentsList.jsx]
   
    export default function CommentsList({ comments }) {
      return (
        <>
          <h3>Comments:</h3>
          {comments.map((comment) => {    // should be (
            <div key={comment.text}>
              <h4>posted by: {comment.postedBy}</h4>
              <p>{comment.text}</p>
            </div>
          })}      // should be ))}
        </>
      );
    }

    CORRECTION:
    ---------------------------------------
    The issue was with the map() callback.
    The syntax to correct this was small but important, wrapping JSX in ()

        ...
        {comments.map((comment) => (
            <div key={comment.text}>
              <h4>posted by: {comment.postedBy}</h4>
              <p>{comment.text}</p>
            </div>
        ))}    


4. Attention: The course uses "react-router-dom" version 6.4
   If you use "react-router-dom" version 7.6.1, you will run into errors in ch4.
   Using react-router-dom version 7.6.1 presents the following error in the Web Browser Console:
   
     "No `HydrateFallback` element provided to render during initial hydration"

   This error is displayed in chapter 4 "creating an upvote button".
   This error is NOT displayed when using react-router-dom 6.4.
